### Data Science Fundamentals: Python
 
[![Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/enterlifeonline/techtalentsouth/blob/master/datascience/python/index.ipynb)

Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.

### Data Science Fundamentals: R

[![Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/enterlifeonline/techtalentsouth/blob/master/datascience/r/index.ipynb)

R is a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing. The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis.



### Data Science Fundamentals: Python-based Web Framework - Django 
[![Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/enterlifeonline/techtalentsouth/blob/master/datascience/frameworks/18_mod_django/index.ipynb)

Django is a Python-based free and open-source web framework, which follows the model-template-view architectural pattern.

### Data Science Fundamentals: Python-based Web Framework - Flask 

[![Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/enterlifeonline/techtalentsouth/blob/master/datascience/frameworks/19_mod_flask/index.ipynb)

Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.

## Software

Anaconda is a free and open-source[6] distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing (data science, machine learning applications, large-scale data processing, predictive analytics, etc.), that aims to simplify package management and deployment. The distribution includes data-science packages suitable for Windows, Linux, and macOS. 

- Anaconda (packages included) - https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
- Miniconda (only Conda and Python packages included) - https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

### Installation

To install the requirements using [conda](http://conda.pydata.org), run the following at the command-line:

```
$ conda install --file requirements.txt
```

To create a stand-alone environment named ``PDSH`` with Python 3.5 and all the required package versions, run the following:

```
$ conda create -n PDSH python=3.5 --file requirements.txt
```

You can read more about using conda environments in the [Managing Environments](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html) section of the conda documentation.

## Package Application Managers

You can install the executables of Anaconda, Conda, Python or you can use a Package Application Manager that is applicable to your operating system. This allows you to maintain, update, install and configure all the necessary software components via automated scripting.

- [Brew (OS X, Linux)](https://brew.sh/)
- [Chocolatey (Windows)](https://chocolatey.org/)

## What is BREW?

For Mac OS, Linux

Home-brew installs the stuff you need that Apple or your Linux system didn’t.  
[See list of all packages](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/)


	⁃	BREW package definition files are called “formulae”
	⁃	BREW “cask”, just like a formula, is for GUI installs.
	⁃	BREW “cellar” is where everything is installed /usr/local/Cellar


The simplest way to create a formula for your own software is to create a GitHub repository called homebrew-<something>; put your formula file in it; then type brew tap <username>/<something> to add this new source of formulae to your Homebrew installation and so get access to all its formulae.

Companies have internal Homebrew taps for their own utilities. There are a lot of public taps like homebrew/science for scientific software, atlassian/tap for Atlassian software, and ska-sa/tap for radio astronomy.

**[Brew Formulae / Casks](https://formulae.brew.sh/)**

## What is CHOCOLATEY?

For Windows

Chocolatey has the largest online registry of Windows packages. Chocolatey packages encapsulate everything required to manage a particular piece of software into one deployment artifact by wrapping installers, executables, zips, and/or scripts into a compiled package file.

[Search all Chocolatey Packages](https://chocolatey.org/packages)
