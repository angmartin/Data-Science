    "\n",
    "We have already seen that we can ask from a string `str`\n",
    "whether it begins with some substring as follows:\n",
    "`str.startswith('Apple')`.\n",
    "If we would like to know whether it starts with `\"Apple\"` or\n",
    "`\"apple\"`, we would have to call `startswith` method twice.\n",
    "Regular expressions offer a simpler solution:\n",
    "`re.match(r\"[Aa]pple\", str)`.\n",
    "The bracket notation is one example of the special syntax of\n",
    "*regular expressions*. In this case it says that any of the\n",
    "characters inside brackets will do: either `\"A\"` or `\"a\"`. The other\n",
    "letters in `\"pple\"` will act normally. The string `r\"[Aa]pple\"` is\n",
    "called a *pattern*.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more complicated example asks whether the string `str`\n",
    "starts with either `apple` or `banana` (no matter if the first letter\n",
    "is capital or not):\n",
    "`re.match(r\"[Aa]pple|[Bb]anana\", str)`.\n",
    "In this example we saw a new special character `|` that denotes\n",
    "an alternative. On either side of the bar character we have a\n",
    "*subpattern*.\n",
    "\n",
    "A legal variable name in Python starts with a letter or an\n",
    "underline character and the following characters can also be\n",
    "digits.\n",
    "So legal names are, for instance: `_hidden`, `L_value`, `A123_`.\n",
    "But the name `2abc` is not a valid variable name.\n",
    "Let’s see what would be the regular expression pattern to\n",
    "recognise valid variable names:\n",
    "`r\"[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z_0-9]*\\Z\"`.\n",
    "Here we have used a shorthand for character ranges: `A-Z`.\n",
    "This means all the characters from `A` to `Z`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first character of the variable name is defined in the first\n",
    "brackets. The subsequent characters are defined in the second\n",
    "brackets.\n",
    "The special character `*` means that we allow any number\n",
    "(0,1,2, . . . ) of the previous subpattern. For example the\n",
    "pattern `r\"ba*\"` allows strings `\"b\"`, `\"ba\"`, `\"baa\"`, `\"baaa\"`, and\n",
    "so on.\n",
    "The special syntax `\\Z` denotes the end of the string.\n",
    "Without it we would also accept `abc-` as a valid name since\n",
    "the `match` function normally checks only that a string starts with a pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "The special notations, like `\\Z`, also cause problems with string\n",

    "Remember that normally in string literals we have some\n",

    "so on.\n",
    "So, both string literals and regular expressions use similar\n",
    "looking notations, which can create serious confusion.\n",
    "This can be solved by using the so-called *raw strings*. We\n",
    "denote a raw string by having an `r` letter before the first\n",
    "quotation mark, for example `r\"ab*\\Z\"`.\n",

    "commonality; some regular structure.\n",
    "Regular expressions (RE) are a classical computer science topic.\n",

    "languages, like Python, are very fluent in regular expressions.\n",
    "Very complex text processing can be achieved using regular\n",
    "expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In patterns, normal characters (letters, numbers) just represent\n",

    "some special meaning.\n",
    "Punctuation characters have special meaning, unless preceded\n",
    "by backslash (`\\`), which deprives their special meaning.\n",

    "We can use parentheses to create groupings inside a pattern:\n",

    "and so on.\n",
    "These groups are also given a reference number starting from 1. \n",
    "We can refer to groups using backreferences: `\\number`.\n",

    "aca aca\"`, `\"turn turn turn\"`. But not the strings `\"aca\n",
    "aba aca\"` or `\"ac ac ac\"`.\n",
    "\n",

After Python has started your program, the command line parameters are visible as follows. The name of the program is in `sys.argv[0]`. The rest of the command line parameters are after the program name in this list: `sys.argv[1]==\"param1\"`, `sys.argv[2]==\"param2\"`, and so on. The command line parameters can be useful in adjusting the behaviour of your program. A few examples of these will be in the following exercises.
