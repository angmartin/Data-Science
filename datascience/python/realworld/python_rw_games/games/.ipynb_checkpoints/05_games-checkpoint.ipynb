    "At its core, ppb provides a number of features that make it perfect for video games. The GameEngine itself provides a pluggable subsystem architecture where adding new features is as simple as subclassing and extending System. Additionally, it contains a state stack of Scenes simple containers that let you organize game scenes and UI screens in a simple way.\n",

    "The entire system uses an event system which is as extensible as the rest of the system. Register new values to existing event types, and even overwrite the defaults. Adding a new event type to the system is as simple as firing an instance of your new event class with signal. Instead of a publisher system, the engine knows everything in its own scope and only calls objects with appropriate callbacks. The most basic event is Update and your handlers should match the signature on_update(self, update_event, signal)."
