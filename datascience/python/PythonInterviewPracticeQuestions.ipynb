    "The first solution is a standard step-by-step approach to questions like this. However, it is not an optimal solution.\n",
    "A more Pythonic solution is to use a replace() method to directly change “.” with “[.]”, shown as follows."

    "There is just one catch: there are numbers that are multiples of 2 and 3, so we have to decide at the top of the control flow.\n",
    "Since there are only three conditions to check, we can write a control flow. However, there are cases then the number of sub-conditions is just too many, and it becomes impossible to list them out (e.g., question 1 uniform distribution). Your interviewer may ask you to use other methods than control flow.\n",
