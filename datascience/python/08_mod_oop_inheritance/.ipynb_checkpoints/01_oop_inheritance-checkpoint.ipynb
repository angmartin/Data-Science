    "in creating a new class `C`.\n",
    "Let’s recap how the attribute lookup worked for classes.\n",
    "When looking for an attribute, the lookup procedure starts\n",
    "with the instance dictionary, and continues with the class\n",
    "attributes.\n",
    "If both fail, then the attribute is searched from the base\n",
    "classes and, recursively, from their base classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, it may look like we access an attribute of a class `C`, when\n",
    "in reality we are accessing the attribute of its base class `B`.\n",
    "In this case we say that the class `C` *inherits* the attribute from\n",
    "its base class `B`.\n",
    "If we have attributes with the same name in both the class\n",
    "and its base class, the attribute of the base class is hidden.\n",

    "Method Resolution Order (MRO) denotes the way a programming language resolves a method or attribute. Python supports classes inheriting from other classes. The class being inherited is called the Parent or Superclass, while the class that inherits is called the Child or Subclass. In python, method resolution order defines the order in which the base classes are searched when executing a method. First, the method or attribute is searched within a class and then it follows the order we specified while inheriting. This order is also called Linearization of a class and set of rules are called MRO(Method Resolution Order). While inheriting from another class, the interpreter needs a way to resolve the methods that are being called via an instance. Thus we need the method resolution order."
