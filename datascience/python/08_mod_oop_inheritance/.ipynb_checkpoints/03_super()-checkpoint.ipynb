    "Python super() function allows us to refer to the parent class explicitly. It’s useful in case of inheritance where we want to call super class functions.So, Python super makes our task easier and comfortable. While referring the superclass from the subclass, we don’t need to write the name of superclass explicitly. super() alone returns a temporary object of the superclass that then allows you to call that superclass’s methods.\n",
