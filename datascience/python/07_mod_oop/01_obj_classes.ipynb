    "\n",
    "Every value in Python is an object.\n",
    "Objects are a way to combine data and the functions that\n",

    "This combination is called *encapsulation*.\n",
    "The data items and functions of objects are called *attributes*,\n",
    "and in particular the function attributes are called *methods*.\n",
    "For example, the operator `+` on integers calls a method of\n",

    "* stored in a container\n",
    "* passed to a function as a parameter\n",
    "* returned by a function\n",
    "* bound to a variable\n",
    "\n",
    "One can access an attribute of an object using the *dot\n",
    "operator*: `object.attribute`.\n",
    "For example: if `L` is a list, we can refer to the method `append`\n",
    "with `L.append`. The method call can look, for instance, like\n",
    "this: `L.append(4)`.\n",

    "While the class is the blueprint, an **instance** is an object that is built from a class and contains real data. An instance of the Dog class is not a blueprint anymore. It’s an actual dog with a name, like Miles, who’s four years old.\n",
